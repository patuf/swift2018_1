05 - Too complex logic that tires you.
06_Calculator: No need to keep instance variables. The state of the calc could be its memory, or last result
06_Credentials: Credentials is a class that represents a single credential (user + pass)

Anton:
  05_Person: With empty constructor, age needs to be -1
  06_Calculator: It is semantically incorrect for Calculator to hold its operands apriori
Atanas:
  05_Person: fields/properties start with small letter
             age, not year.
  06_Calculator: It is semantically incorrect for Calculator to hold its operands apriori
  06_Credentials: Consider using switch when examining the command
                  Credentials is a class that represents a single credential (user + pass)
Georgi:
  05_Car: Current year is LocalDate.now().getYear()
          Category 1 is 0 - 8 years
          + Good on the else statement
          insuranceCategory can be reused in tax calculation - we cannot get the two pieces of info separately otherwise.
Hazel:
  05_Person: Indents!

Hristo:
  05_Car: + Nice conditional expressions and switch
           Methods should either calculate once and use instance properties, or calculate every time and stay transient.
  05_Person: Undefined name is "No name", not null
  06_Calculator: No need to keep instance variables.
                 Assign instance vals to parameters?
                 instance vars a, b are never used
  06_Credentials: Credentials is a class that represents a single credential (user + pass)

Iva:
  05_Credentials: Introduction should be part of the Person behaviour!
                  Introduction doesn't meet the task description.
  05_Car: Don't call insuranceCategory so many times - call it once and use it in switch.
          + Clean conditions, good overall code (except the above)
  06_Calculator: No need to keep instance variables.
                 Task is not part of calculator.

Mariya:
  05_Car: Reuse call to insuranceCategory, instead of taking it as param in taxes. Use the power of OOP.

Racho:
  05_Person: method names with small case
             Use good old String, not char. This is not C
  05_Car: insCat and tax are part of the Car behaviour

Ognyan:
  05_Person: No John Doe
  05_Car: Use switch for tax(feeds)
